#Python Mini-Project: Sal's Shipping
#Objective: write several functions that calculate the cost of different methods of shipping given an inputted weight as a parameter, then write a final function that determines the cheapest shipping option and final cost given an inputted weight. 
#Project provided by Codecademy Pro Data Science Pathway
#Original code by Faith Lierheimer

#Part I: Define a function that calculates the cost of ground shipping based on the weight of a package and the associated flat charge. 
def ground_shipping(weight):
  if weight <= 2:
    return weight*1.5 + 20
  elif weight > 2 and weight <= 6:
    return weight*3.0 + 20
  elif weight > 6 and weight <= 10:
    return weight *4.0 + 20
  else:
    return weight*4.75 + 20
#Test function
print(ground_shipping(8.4))

#Part II: Define flat cost of premium ground shipping as a variable to use for later.
premium_ground_shipping = 125.0

#Part III: Define a function that calculates the cost of drone shipping based on the weight of a package. No associated flat charge here.
def drone_shipping(weight):
  if weight <= 2:
    return weight*4.50
  elif weight > 2 and weight <= 6:
    return weight*9.0
  elif weight > 6 and weight <= 10:
    return weight * 12.0
  else:
    return weight * 14.25
print(drone_shipping(1.5))

#Part IV: Define a function that uses the previous defined functions to determine the cheapest shipping option for an object of a given weight, and returns the cheapest option and the shipping price. 
def cheapest_option(weight):
  if ground_shipping(weight) < drone_shipping(weight) and ground_shipping(weight) < premium_ground_shipping:
    return "Ground shipping is your cheapest option. It costs $" + str(ground_shipping(weight))
  elif drone_shipping(weight) < ground_shipping(weight) and drone_shipping(weight)< premium_ground_shipping:
    return "Drone shipping is your cheapest option. It costs $" + str(drone_shipping(weight))
  else:
    return "Premium ground shipping is your cheapest option. It costs $" + str(premium_ground_shipping)
#Test Part IV function with a package that weights 4.8 lbs.
print(cheapest_option(4.8))
