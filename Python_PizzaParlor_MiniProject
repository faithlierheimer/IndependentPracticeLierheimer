#Task 1: Keep track of all the kinds of pizzas we sell with a list called 'toppings'!

toppings = ['pepperoni', 'pineapple', 'cheese', 'sausage', 'olives', 'anchovies', 'mushrooms']

#Task 2: Keep track of how much each kind of pizza slice costs with a list called 'prices'!

prices = [2, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 2]

#Task 3: Find the length of the 'toppings' list and store it in a variable called num_pizzas. 

num_pizzas = len(toppings)
print(num_pizzas)

#Task 4: Print how many different kinds of pizza we sell! 
print("We sell " + str(num_pizzas), "different kinds of pizza!")

#Task 5: Use zip to combine the above two lists into a list called pizzas with price first. 

pizzas = list(zip(prices, toppings))

print(pizzas)

#Task 6: Sort 'pizzas' so the pizzas with the lowest price are at the start of the list. 

pizzas.sort()
print(pizzas)

#Task 7: Store the first element of pizzas in a variable called cheapest_pizza. 

cheapest_pizza = pizzas[0]
print(cheapest_pizza)

#Task 8: Store the last element of pizzas in a variable called priciest_pizza. 

priciest_pizza = pizzas[-1]
print(priciest_pizza)

#Task 9: Store & print the three lowest cost pizzas in a list called three_cheapest. 

three_cheapest = pizzas[0:3]
print(three_cheapest)

#Task 10: Count the number of occurrences of $2 pizzas in the prices list, and store the result in a variable called num_two_dollar_slices. Print it. 

num_two_dollar_slices = prices.count(2)

print(num_two_dollar_slices)
