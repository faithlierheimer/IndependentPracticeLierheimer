/*Result tells us email newsletter and Facebook retargetting ad get the
most last touches on the purchase page at 115 and 113 respectively, with the email
retargetting campaign and the paid search coming in at 54 and 52 respectively.*\

/*So, which campaigns should they reinvest in, if they can only pick 5?
The weekly newsletter and the facebook retargetting ads account for 2/3
of the last touches that lead to a purchase, so those are the obvious 
first two choices. The media coverage in Medium and NYTimes resulted in
over 600 first touches each, so those are also good candidates for 
reinvestment if other media coverage is possible. Finally, the buzzfeed 
article about Cool T Shirts resulted in over 500 first touches,
and makes the most sense as a 5th reinvestment given that the other last touch
sources that got a purchase were under 100 each, it makes more sense to invest in
a high volume first touch source. *\
