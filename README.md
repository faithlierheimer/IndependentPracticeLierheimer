# IndependentPracticeLierheimer
This is where I will store code from my independent practice on different languages and projects outside of my data analytics bootcamp. 

As of 5/11/2020, this repository contains code demonstrating my knowledge of basic SQL functionality applied in different contexts, including marketing attribution, churn rates, and world population data. Currently, this code demonstrates knowledge of basic SQL queries, aggregate functions, creating, merging, and managing multiple tables, using temporary tables to perform calculations, and applying these concepts in the aforementioned three contexts.
