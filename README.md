# IndependentPracticeLierheimer
This is where I will store code from my independent practice on different languages and projects outside of my data analytics bootcamp. 

As of 5/24/2020, this repository contains code demonstrating my knowledge of basic SQL functionality applied in different contexts, including marketing attribution, churn rates, and world population data. Currently, this code demonstrates knowledge of basic SQL queries, aggregate functions, creating, merging, and managing multiple tables, using temporary tables to perform calculations, and applying these concepts in the aforementioned three contexts. 

It also contains code demonstrating my knowledge of baseline Python functionality, including writing and updating functions, using multiple functions within another function, if/elif/else logic, and assigning and using variables in Python. Other Python skills demonstrated in this mini-project repository include working with and manipulating lists, basic for and while loops, as well as list comprehensions.
