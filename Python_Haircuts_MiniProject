#Task 1: Existing lists that show hairstyles available, prices, and sales made last week. 
hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

#Task 2: Initialize total_price as a variable with an initial value of 0 to be added to in a for loop. 
total_price = 0

#Task 3: Add up all the prices of haircuts to calculate the average price of a cut using a for loop, then calculate the average price of a cut. Print all results. 
for price in prices:
  total_price += price

print(total_price)

num_prices = len(prices)
print(num_prices)

average_price = total_price/num_prices

print("Average Haircut Price: $"+ str(average_price))

#Task 4: Use a list comprehension to modify the original price list by reducign the price of each cut by $5. 
new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]

print(new_prices)

#Task 5: Calculate revenue from the previous week by writing a for loop that iterates through each element of the hairstyles list and adds up the price of each hairstyle multiplied by the number of cuts of that style provided in the previous week, then printing the results. 
total_revenue = 0
print(len(hairstyles))
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  revenue = prices[i]*last_week[i]
  total_revenue += revenue
  i += 1 
print("Total Revenue: $" + str(total_revenue))

#Task 6: Calculate the average daily revenue. 
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue/7
print(average_daily_revenue)

#Task 7: Use a list comprehension to create a new list of haircuts under $30 to attract more customers. 
cuts_under_30 = [cut for cut in new_prices if cut < 30]
print(cuts_under_30)
